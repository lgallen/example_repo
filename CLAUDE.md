# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a learning/example repository containing Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for exploring algorithms and machine learning concepts.

## Development Environment

- Python 3.12 with virtual environment in `venv/`
- Activate: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Key packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter, requests

## Running Code

```bash
# Run Python scripts
python test.py

# Run Jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook sklearn_pipeline_example.ipynb
```

## Repository Contents

- `test.py`, `text.py`: Basic algorithm examples (Fibonacci)
- `sklearn_pipeline_example.ipynb`: Complete ML pipeline tutorial demonstrating data acquisition, preprocessing pipelines, GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using NCAA basketball data
